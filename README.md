Before you ask for help
-----------------------
* Make sure you have read the [FAQ](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/FAQ)
* Make sure you have [validated](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/Validating-if-APIs-work-on-ZM) that your APIs are working (if not, its a ZM issue, please post in ZM forums)
* Please don't ask me for help with source compilation if you are not familiar with coding mobile apps - you should try and solve your own problems

Thanks
------
To the zonemider community in general, and the awesome Stack Overflow community.
But specifically, [Andrew Bauer](https://github.com/knight-of-ni) (knight-of-ni) who egged me on to take up this project and [Isaac Connor](http://github.com/connortechnology/) who has been incredibly supportive in helping fix various ZM issues that affected zmNinja

Important Notes
---------------
* zmNinja needs APIs enabled in ZoneMinder. If you are running ZM 1.29 or above, APIs should automatically be available. See [this](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/Validating-if-APIs-work-on-ZM) for instructions on how to make sure your APIs are working. If they are not working, zmNinja **will not** work.


Why did I develop zmNinja?
------------------------------
* I wanted to learn how to write a mobile app. It was (and is) fun. 
* I originally reached out to tinyCam to see if they were willing to do an app - did not get a response
* I found zmView limited for my needs

Running from source
----------------------
Please follow [these](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/Running-zmNinja-from-Source) instructions.
