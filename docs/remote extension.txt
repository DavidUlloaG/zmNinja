### Add Picture Notification Support (Optional)

  
  529  ionic cordova platform remove ios
  530  ionic cordova platform add ios
  531  open platforms/ios/

Open up platforms/ios/zmNinja.xcworkspace
File->New->Target->Notification Service Extension
In the "Product Name" put in zmNinjaNotification (your BundleID should now read  com.pliablepixels.zmninja-pro.zmNinjaNotification)
Say "Yes" to "Activate zmNinjaNotification scheme?" popup
Now in XCode Targets, select zmNinjaNotification, and make sure you select a Team and make sure Deployment Target is 10 or above


  532  cp www/external/NotificationService.swift platforms/ios/zmNinjaNotication/
  533  cp www/external/NotificationService.swift platforms/ios/zmNinjaNotification/
  534  cd platforms/ios/
  535  pod install


Search path "${PROJECT_DIR}" recursive in zmNinjaNotification and archive?

For Distribution:

always embed swift standard libraries to No in both? (every time after cordova prepare)
make versions same in both - only needed for product archive
